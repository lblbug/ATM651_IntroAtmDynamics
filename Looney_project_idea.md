For my final project, I want to do an analysis of the recent 2015-2016 El Nino. While looking at this event, I am hoping to possibly see an atmospheric teleconnection that connects to the winds in the NE Pacific. Furthermore, if this proves to be “easy” and straightforward, then I am also interested in seeing if there is a trace of why the 2014 “ENSO” event “failed”. I plan to use IDV and MERRA2 for this.
